= .vimrc for older boxes

My minimal vimrc I tend to use on older boxes I have to work with.

== Install
  curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/habamax/vimrc/master/.vimrc

or just plain old copy paste.

== "Features"

* "better built-in" colors (embedded https://github.com/habamax/vim-bronzage[vim-bronzage]) 
* NIH `vim-commentary` alike `gc` and `gcc`
* Eval vimscript with `<space>v`
* `vim-unimpaired` like toggles with `yoh`, `yon` etc
* quickfix mappings `[q`, `]q` etc
* swap, backup, undo files are in separate `~/.vimdata` directory
