= .vimrc for older boxes

My minimal vimrc I tend to use on older boxes I have to work with.

== Install
  curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/habamax/vimrc/master/.vimrc

or just plain old copy paste.

== "Features"

* "better built-in" colors (256 palette)
* NIH vim-commentary alike `gc` and `gcc`
* Eval vimscript with `<space>v`
* vim-unimpaired like toggles with `yoh`, `yon` etc
* quickfix mappings `[q`, `]q` etc
